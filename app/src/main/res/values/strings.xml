    <string name="search_description">I do not care about your user experience. This is how this search works:
        Enter text to search for states or quotes. To filter by Asshole
        density enter a number between 0 and 100. The search will look for states with a density
        greater than the number you entered. To search by state size in square miles,
        enter a number greater than 100. The search will look for states that are smaller than
        that number.</string>
